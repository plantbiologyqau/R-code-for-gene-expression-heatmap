# R-code-for-gene-expression-heatmap
This repository is to develop heatmaps from wheat RNAseq data on Pakistani wheat cultivars. The data has been published in Scientific Data (Maqbool et al. 2023). 

1) The heatmap of specific genes can be developed by using R code from "heatmap_script.R" and two input files. First input file is the source count data file containing all the gene expression values (), and the second file contains the list of genes for which heatmaps needs to be made. 

2) The second set of files is used for correlation analysis of phenotypes with the gene expression data. The R code is described as "source_code_corr.R". The phenotypic data is described as "Phenotypes_RNAseq_Root.csv", and the gene expression values are described as "RNAseq_Root.csv".
